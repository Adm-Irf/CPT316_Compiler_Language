Code Explaination : 

.hpp vs .cpp

.hpp (Header File)
- Serve the same fundamental as .h file in C/C++
- To declare elements that are defined in .cpp file

.cpp (Source File)
- Contain the actual implementation of function and classes declared in .hpp
- Tells the compiler of *how it should works*

k = (a * (b + c)) - ((d / e) + f);
z = (((a + b) * (c - d)) / ((e + f) - (g / h))) + i;
